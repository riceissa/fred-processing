This repository has scripts for obtaining and processing some data from
[FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/ "“Federal Reserve Economic Data | FRED | St. Louis Fed”. Retrieved October 27, 2017.").
The main script is `proc.py`, which does tags fetching, series ID fetching, and
the actual data gathering.
